# DANN-image-classifier
This is a PyTorch-based Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) designed to classify road conditions (Clear vs. Degraded) across shifting environments. Using a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), it forces the feature extractor to remain invariant to weather "noise," ensuring robust performance in rain, fog, or snow.
Note: This repository contains the core architecture and training logic. Dataset paths are currently placeholders as the original project data have not still uploaded.
