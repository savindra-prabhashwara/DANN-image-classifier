ClearSight ADAS is a PyTorch-based Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) designed to classify road conditions (Clear vs. Degraded) across shifting environments. Using a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), it forces the feature extractor to remain invariant to weather "noise," ensuring robust performance in rain, fog, or snow.
